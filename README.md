# C Programming for Beginners - Master the C Language

This repository contains the Examples, Exercises, and Solutions
for Section 5 of C Programming for Beginners: Master the C Language
by Jason Fedin, which covers basic data types, enums and chars, 
format specifiers, and command line arguments.

See the following link for this course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/" target="_blank" title="C Programming">C Programming for Beginners</a>

In this repository, I incorporated Code::Blocks Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) and the Vim text editor along with Git and GitHub
into my workflow. I also used the Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox
environment to create, use, and manage directories and files as I worked
through the section.

Please feel free to reach out to me at devildoc300@gmail.com
if you have any questions or comments. In addition, feel free to
utilize the source code for your consumption and edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, build, and execute the Section 5 files and directories,

    (1) click on the blue "Code" button above and click the 
        "Download Zip" link, or
    (2) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite,
        or Code::Blocks, for example, or your preferred text
        editor, Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example
    (3) and either compile, build, and execute the files in your IDE
    (4) or use the following command-line script:

            $ gcc name_of_file.c -o main
            $ ./main
